                    <p>One of the most emotionally daunting experiences for me over the past few months has been losing
                        people who were once my friends. This is particularly so because for someone like me who is
                        extremely slow to make friends, losing the few that I have can be quite heart-breaking.
                        Why did I dissolve those friendships? Simply put, they weren’t able to confront me and call out
                        my
                        missteps when I made terrible mistakes; they simply kept mute, overlooked it, or gave me the
                        silent
                        treatment. <br> <br>
                        You see, I am a very flawed human. Too flawed, almost. But I am also very passionate about
                        personal
                        growth and learning from mistakes. Living at the epicentre of this dichotomy can sometimes make
                        me
                        seem like a hypocrite. Especially when you juxtapose my actions with the beliefs and values I
                        supposedly uphold. But, for what it’s worth, I believe that there is more potential for learning
                        in
                        our failures than in our successes. My friends know this; or are supposed to, at least. <br>
                        <br>
                        For me, this year so far has been a patchwork of meritorious successes and disastrous mistakes.
                        I
                        have achieved things I never imagined and I have also made some terrible decisions that I will
                        forever live to regret. In my successes, my friends have always been there to cheer me on,
                        support
                        me, and push me to consistently outdo myself and aim for even greater heights. But in those
                        moments
                        when I crumbled and exposed flaws in my character, not all of my friends stuck around to counsel
                        me.
                        Some of them simply cut me off because they were either too disappointed or too sanctimonious to
                        be
                        associated with such. In those early stages, parts of me kept yearning to reach out to them to
                        apologise and try to mend things. But after much thought, I stopped myself. <br> <br>
                        I came to the understanding that it is in those moments when we make unforgivable mistakes,
                        experience terrible losses, make catastrophic judgements that we find out who our real friends
                        are.
                        In those moments, a true friend will sit you down and scold you, counsel you, yell at you, or
                        slap
                        some sense into you if they must. Why? Because they are personally invested in your development
                        as
                        an individual and, in other cases, as a professional. <br> <br>
                        They stick with you through these rough times and rebuild you from the ashes of your many
                        errors.
                        Why? Because they believe you can do better; they know you can do better! These people will do
                        whatever they can to make you a better version of you. <br> <br>
                        True, your friends reflect you and, as a result, you would want them to possess traits that sit
                        well
                        with you. But if one of them begins to show traits that you do not want to be associated with,
                        don’t
                        walk out on them immediately. Talk to them, show them the light, get them to improve. If they
                        resist, only then do you have the justification to let them go. <br> <br>
                        In the end, the yearning to reach out to those friends who chose to walk out of my life ceased.
                        I
                        let them go. If they could walk out on me when I fell and needed them the most, sooner or later
                        when
                        I make even worse mistakes (hopefully not) as a result of my naturally flawed humanity, they
                        would
                        most likely still walk out on me. If they couldn’t have those difficult conversations with me
                        when I
                        went astray, then there was no point in sustaining a friendship where we are unable to reprimand
                        one
                        another when we err. <br> <br>
                        As someone who is passionate about building my friends from their successes, struggles, and
                        failures, it is very important that I also be surrounded by people who are equally passionate
                        about
                        building me. <br> <br>
                        Maybe I shouldn’t have let those friends walk out. Maybe I should have pursued them. Maybe I was
                        also a bad friend since I couldn’t sit them down and have a conversation about how I felt as a
                        result of their response to my mistakes. Instead, I simply decided to write a posthumous article
                        about the entire experience — which they are probably reading now. <br> <br>
                        I guess that explains why I am no longer in their circle of friends and they are no longer in
                        mine.
                        I am, clearly, also not perfect.
